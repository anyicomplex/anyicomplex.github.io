      <description>Feasibility Java is said to be a pure object-oriented programming language, so can you write procedural-oriented C-style code in Java?
There are no pointers in Java, but there are references, so the answer is obviously yes.
The difference in style Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two pieces of pseudo-code.
C style struct Foo foo; change_foo_value(&amp;amp;foo, 0); Java style Foo foo = new Foo(); foo.changeValue(0); This also shows the difference between the two design patterns, object-oriented and procedure-oriented.</description>

      <description>Is Java suitable for developing games? My answer is: NO.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not focused on open source, established commercial solutions like Unity and GameMaker are obviously the best choices for you.
If you&amp;rsquo;re focused on open source, there are plenty of open source game engines out there (most of them written in C/C++) that are right up your alley. (Not listed here, please search in the major open source platforms by yourself)</description>
