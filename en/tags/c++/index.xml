      <description>Causes Program release has always been a major problem for programmers, especially in the distribution of applets.
If you wrote a small program with limited functionality, but it depends on a heavy runtime in dozens of megabytes, I believe that many users will not think it&amp;rsquo;s worth to use.
If you refute me with reasons like &amp;ldquo;hard disks are now at a cabbage price&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;network bandwidth is worthless now that we&amp;rsquo;re in the 5G era&amp;rdquo;, then please close this blog post immediately because it&amp;rsquo;s not written for you.</description>

      <title>Writing and Compiling win32 Programs under Linux</title>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;win32&amp;rdquo; in this article is the common name for winapi in mainland China programmers&#39; circles, not specifically for 32-bit winapi (not to mention 64-bit, we also calling the earlier 16-bit winapi &amp;ldquo;win32&amp;rdquo; since the appearance of 32-bit winapi).
Feasibility Thanks to the MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) project, it is perfectly feasible to compile win32 applications as long as not involve higher-level packaging (MFC, WPF, etc.). (There are actually various tricks to use MFC and WPF, but I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend it, and if you want to do that, it might be better to use MSVC under Wine)</description>

      <description>Fundamentals   Learn C first before learning C++, master basic concepts such as stacks and piles, be comfortable with pointers and macros.
  Latest C++ features should not be learned yet, even if only for learning and not production, it is also recommended to use only long-term supported stable versions.
  Applications
  Don&amp;rsquo;t rush into advanced C++ features such as templates yet.
  Don&amp;rsquo;t look for a third-party library if it&amp;rsquo;s the same feature available in the STL (unless it&amp;rsquo;s really better than that part of the STL and has been maintained for a long time).</description>

      <title>Writing C-style Java Programs</title>

      <description>Feasibility Java is said to be a pure object-oriented programming language, so can you write procedural-oriented C-style code in Java?
There are no pointers in Java, but there are references, so the answer is obviously yes.
The difference in style Let&amp;rsquo;s start with two pieces of pseudo-code.
C style struct Foo foo; change_foo_value(&amp;amp;foo, 0); Java style Foo foo = new Foo(); foo.changeValue(0); This also shows the difference between the two design patterns, object-oriented and procedure-oriented.</description>
