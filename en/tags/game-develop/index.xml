      <description>Is Java suitable for developing games? My answer is: NO.
If you&amp;rsquo;re not focused on open source, established commercial solutions like Unity and GameMaker are obviously the best choices for you.
If you&amp;rsquo;re focused on open source, there are plenty of open source game engines out there (most of them written in C/C++) that are right up your alley. (Not listed here, please search in the major open source platforms by yourself)</description>
