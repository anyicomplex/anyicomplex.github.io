      <description>新头像（？）
请原谅我的渣画技，连个帽子都画不好XD
说起来就加了个帽子&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
加这个帽子的原因：如果可以的话，我希望将来有一天能到 Red Hat 去上班:D
然而，现在的我，除了编程啥也不会，编程水平也不咋地XP
照这样下去，我估计再过个十年八年也达不到那些大公司招聘的标准
只能认命，接受我自己是个废物的现实QAQ</description>

      <description>I went to bed early last night and got up early this morning, so I thought I might as well do something since I was up early, so I used GIMP to draw a new avatar.
Not saving during drawing. Suddenly, GIMP crashed, together with the desktop, and then&amp;hellip; results of two hours, lost forever QwQ.
This thing told us, we should saving data during working in time, or encounter unexpected conditions, cannot do anything except cry&amp;hellip; Data is priceless!</description>

      <description>I hope that the people of Ukraine will get through this disaster safely.
I hope the war will end sooner and not expand into a world war.
A moment of silence for the dead.</description>

      <description>At the last time I&amp;rsquo;m blogging, I found that the background color of the highlighted code was beige, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like the color, so I changed it.
Then I updated the version of the theme.</description>

      <description>Sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry, I broke my promise&amp;hellip;
Last time I said I would have a huge update, but I ended up writing one blog post&amp;hellip;
Even for Lunar New Year, I didn&amp;rsquo;t post a blog&amp;hellip;
A lot of things happened during this time&amp;hellip;
First, I got addicted to playing Mirage Realms (because it&amp;rsquo;s really fun :D)
Then, I decided to develop the game in Java and libGDX (contradicted myself, details) and did some related work (gdx-svmhelper and gdx-bmfont)</description>

      <description>Recently finally was transferred to a position with a computer
First do something of my own at spare time between tasks
Idle is also idle, why not refurbish the blog :D
This time, almost all the places I think the details are not satisfactory in this theme have been modified, I also modified the home page
I think today is my birthday, I almost forgot it XD</description>

      <description>Two months have passed and I finally remembered this blog again XD
So I&amp;hellip;modified the theme, refurbished a bit, and replaced the comment system from Utterances to Gitalk (of course, because of this, the original comments all no longer exists XP)
New theme: Diary
There will be a huge amount of new (quality-free) blog posts in the next while&amp;hellip;That&amp;rsquo;s probably it! Stay tuned!</description>

      <description>Theme: Github Style (Note: This is the theme used at the beginning of the blog, which has already replaced)
It will probably be a blog of diary nature :D</description>
