Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I broke my promise...  
Last time I said I would have a huge update, but I ended up writing one blog post...  
Even for Lunar New Year, I didn't post a blog...

A lot of things happened during this time...  
First, I got addicted to playing [Mirage Realms](https://www.miragerealms.co.uk) (because it's really fun :D)  
Then, I decided to develop the game in Java and libGDX (contradicted myself, [details](https://anyicomplex.github.io/posts/words-for-those-want-to-develop-game-in-java/)) and did some related work ([gdx-svmhelper](https://github.com/anyicomplex/gdx-svmhelper) and [gdx-bmfont](https://github.com/anyicomplex/gdx-bmfont))  
Then, I made a foreign friend [Berstanio](https://github.com/Berstanio/) (I think he's German, if I'm not mistaken)  
Finally, during this cyber time, I realized that: I need to have a planning list, I need to have short-term goals, I need to do a lot of work, and I need to learn a lot.

For new year, cheers!
