I went to bed early last night and got up early this morning, so I thought I might as well do something since I was up early, so I used GIMP to draw a new avatar.  
Not saving during drawing. Suddenly, GIMP crashed, together with the desktop, and then... results of two hours, lost forever QwQ.

**This thing told us, we should saving data during working in time, or encounter unexpected conditions, cannot do anything except cry... Data is priceless!**
