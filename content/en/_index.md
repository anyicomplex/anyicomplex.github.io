# The whining of a Chinese leek[^bignote] in the GFW

* Currently in a very small, very unscrupulous company, working 6/7/7 day by day (working hours are from 6 a.m to 7 p.m, no vacation unless special circumstances)
* Against such kind of unscrupulous company, as long as I haven't been fired, not only will I not work seriously, I will do my own thing during working hours!!!
* BTW, up to nine consecutive weeks (63 days) not post any blog posts is a **NORMAL** situation (I almost believed it, LOL), (surely, if stopping update more time than this, in 80% probability is I was fired, resulting in a forced stop blogging...)

[^bignote]:Note: "leek (Simplified Chinese: 韭菜)" is a common internet term used by mainland Chinese residents to mock themselves because "leeks" can be harvested repeatedly and are powerless to resist the "sickle (Simplified Chinese: 镰刀)", also an internet term used by mainland Chinese residents to satirize the exploiting class.
